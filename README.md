### Description

A Ruby application that begins with a screenshot of a Sudoku puzzle and outputs a valid solution. The individual tiles of the board are detected using the openCV library. An algorithm loops through the tiles detecting which tiles contain a number. Tesseract OCR is used to translate the image containing a number into machine encoded text. The board is then solved and the final solution displayed on screen.

Technologies Used: Ruby, openCV, Tesseract OCR
